      "Most genes in the *E. coli* genome start with the canonical start codon ATG, but some genes start with other codons, for example GTG. Write a python program that finds all start codons that exist in the *E. coli* genome and that counts how often each start codon is used. The program should then save the results into a csv file that can be used from R. \n",

      "- Running the code over the entire genome can take a while. First make sure that the code works correctly, by limiting the loop to a small number of genes as we did in class 21. Once you are satisifed with your code, let it run over the entire genome.\n",
