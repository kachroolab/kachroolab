### **PROJECT DATES**

**Pick a gene day- Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020** 

## **_The Project is due on March 05, 2020_**

### **GROUP PRESENTATIONS**
Here is a list of group presentations dates for a research articles. The research article will be provided to you at least a week before the presentation. Each presentation will cover ~35 minutes of the lecture. It is a group activity and each group will only use a single powerpoint file for presentation. Each presentation should be organised as follows: 
**Background (2-3 slides), problem addressed (2 slides), results specifically focusing on genetic tools (3-4 slides) and conclusion/summary (1-2 slides). Please send your powerpoint slides to me at least an hour before your presentation and I can upload them on the TopHat.** 
_Those of you who have geniune (Doctor's report required) issues regarding oral presentations must get in touch with me ASAP with appropriate documentation. They will have to summarize the research article (Max. 1-2 pages) and submit it on the day of their group's presentation._ 

## **Please pick your groups before March 19, 2020. Each group must have similar number of students**

**Group I - Thursday, March 19, 2020**
