**TOP HAT**
We will be using the Top Hat (www.tophat.com) classroom response system in class for lectures, quizzes, and attendance. You will be able to submit answers to in-class questions, and I will take attendance via Apple or Android smartphones and tablets, laptops, or via text message (SMS). You can register for Top Hat here (https://app.tophat.com/register/). Top Hat will require a single course price or a subscription. There are multiple options and it costs ~$26 CAD for 1 term subscription (4 months). There may be an additional fee for the Top Hat Test as well. The course code for BIOL367-Fall 2019 is **198379**. **You must register before 2nd September 2019. I expect all the students to have access to the TOPHAT course on September 4 2019**.
