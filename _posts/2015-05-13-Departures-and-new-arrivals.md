Several lab members are graduating and moving on, while new members are joining. Graduate student [Amir Shahmoradi](https://sites.google.com/site/amshportal/home) successfully defended his thesis and can now call himself Dr. Shahmoradi. In the fall, he will join UT's [Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences (ICES)](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/) as a postdoc. Undergraduates Andrew Butler, Eric Dawson, and Keerthana Kumar are all graduating with honors. Andrew will go to graduate school at NYU, and Eric will go to Cambridge as an [NIH Cambridge Scholar.](http://oxcam.gpp.nih.gov/)
Among the new arrivals are graduate students Benjamin Jack and Dariya Sydykova. Both are first-year students in the CMB program, and they are joining the lab after completing their rotations this spring. Dariya is not entirely new to the lab, however, since she also was here as an undergrad from 2012 to 2014.
