In the latest issue of the journal PLoS Computational Biology, [Claus Wilke reviews](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002572) the growing trend in the field of molecular evolution to incorporate molecular structure and function into computational work. This review is part of the popular [Editor's Outlook series](http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pcol.v03.i08) of the journal, where PLoS Computational Biology editors take stock of what computational biology has achieved to date and what it can hope to achieve in the near future.
