The NSF has released [the results](https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/grfp/AwardeeList.do?method=loadAwardeeList) of this year's GRFP competition. Two students in the Wilke Lab were honored. Eleisha Jackson, a graduate student in the EEB program, received a fellowship award. Eleisha is studying the biophysical mechanisms that allow viruses to switch host. Dariya Sydykova, currently an undergrad in computational biology, received honorable mention. Dariya will join the CMB graduate program at UT Austin in the fall.
