[Nature News reports](http://www.nature.com/news/long-wait-for-publication-plagues-many-journals-1.17901) an issue that caused a bit of a stir on social media this week, the long delays between acceptance of a paper and subsequent formal publication. The article prominently features [a Tweet by Claus Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke/status/615892261100871680) of an analysis showing that some publishers, in particular PLOS Computational Biology and PLOS Genetics, frequently take [60-80 days from acceptance to publication.](http://blog.dhimmel.com/plos-and-publishing-delays/) The analysis was carried out by [Daniel Himmelstein of UCSF,](https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/615624280026394625) as he was waiting for the publication of his PLOS Computational Biology article. We are currently caught in the same situation as Daniel is, as we had a paper accepted by PLOS Computational Biology on June 11 and are now waiting for the official publication.
