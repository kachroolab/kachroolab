Last week, nearly the entire lab attended the [BEACON](http://beacon-center.org/)  Congress, where Titus Brown gave a persuasive talk arguing that [scientists should get more involved with social media.](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/fallout-from-social-media-talk.html) In response, we decided to be more active with social media as well. First, we made a [figshare account](http://figshare.com/authors/Claus%20Wilke/447154) for the lab and posted several of the posters and slides we presented at the BEACON Congress. Second, we [tweeted](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke) about the materials we posted on figshare. Third, Claus decided to [start a blog,](http://serialmentor.com) where he will post his personal opinions on scientific as well as non-scientific topics.
