In this month's issue of [PLOS Pathogens](http://www.plospathogens.org/article/browse/issue/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.ppat.v11.i05), Wilke-lab postdoc [Austin Meyer](http://meyerlab.org/) is publishing an article providing [a fresh look at influenza hemagglutinin evolution.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004940) The influenza virus is one of the most rapidly evolving human viruses. Every year, it accumulates mutations that allow it to evade the host immune response of previously infected individuals. Which sites in the virusâ€™ genome allow this immune escape is not entirely understood, but conventional wisdom states that specific "immune epitope sites" in the protein hemagglutinin are preferentially attacked by host antibodies and that these sites mutate to directly avoid host recognition; as a result, these sites are commonly targeted by vaccine development efforts. Our analysis has found, however, that the available epitope sites are poor predictors of which sites in influenza hemagglutinin evolve rapidly. Instead, we find that a simple geometrical model works best: Sites that are closest to the location where the virus binds the human receptor and are exposed to solvent are the primary drivers of hemagglutinin evolution. This result suggests that either the available epitope sites do not accurately represent the true influenza antigenic sites or that host immune bias may be less important for influenza evolution than commonly thought.
