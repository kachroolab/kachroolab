In June 2017, we published our work on [systematic bacterialization of essential genes in baker's yeast](https://elifesciences.org/articles/25093) in eLife journal. This work showed that many essential yeast genes can be replaced by their bacterial counterparts, despite over 2 billion years of evolutionary divergence between prokaryotes and eukaryotes identifying ancient heme biosynthesis as a universally swappable pathway.

This work was highlighted even before publication at [Science News](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swapping-analogous-genes-no-problem-among-species), [The Daily Texan](http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2016/08/22/disease-research-kneads-yeast)
