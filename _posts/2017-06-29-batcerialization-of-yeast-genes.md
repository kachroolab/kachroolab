In June 2017, we published our work on [systematic bacterialization of essential genes in baker's yeast.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/25093) in eLife journal. This work showed that many essential yeast genes can be replaced by their bacterial counterparts, despite over 2 billion years of evolutionary divergence between prokaryotes and eukaryotes identifying ancient heme biosynthesis as a universally swappable pathway.

This article was highlighted even before publication at [Science News](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swapping-analogous-genes-no-problem-among-species)
