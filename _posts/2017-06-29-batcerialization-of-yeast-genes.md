In June 2017, we published an article on [systematic bacterialization of essential genes in baker's yeast.](https://elifesciences.org/articles/25093) This work showed that many of the essential yeast genes can be replaced by their bacterial counterparts, despite over 2 billion years of evolutionary divergence between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

This article was highlighted even before publication at [Science News](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/swapping-analogous-genes-no-problem-among-species)
