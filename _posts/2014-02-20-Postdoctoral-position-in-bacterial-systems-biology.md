The Wilke Lab at UT Austin has an open position for a postdoc in computational systems biology. This position is part of an ARO-funded project to investigate how bacterial growth conditions shape bacterial physiology. A successful candidate will use statistical approaches and/or mechanistic models of gene-regulation and metabolism to link bacterial growth conditions with measures of cellular physiology such as RNA and protein abundances. The overarching project goals are to develop new approaches for predicting bacterial growth conditions from the observed phenotype.
