We recently published a protocol on [Single-step Precision Genome Editing in Yeast Using CRISPR-Cas9](https://bio-protocol.org/e2765) This protocol can be used to precisely modify any location in the yeast genome (essential or non-essential) without the need for intermnediate strains carrying antibiotic or auxotrophic markers. We successfully demonstrated, uisng this protocol, to functionally replace essential yeast genes at their native yeast loci with their corresponding bacterial or human orthologs [Systematic Bacterilazation of Yeast Genes](https://elifesciences.org/articles/25093). This protocol can be used to add N-terminal or C-terminal tags and introduce muations in yeast using appropriate repair templates (HDR-Homology Directed Repair) or simply just mutate yeast genes (via NHEJ-Non-Homologous End Joining) without any repair templates.
