We recently published a protocol on [Single-step Precision Genome Editing in Yeast Using CRISPR-Cas9](https://bio-protocol.org/e2765). This protocol can be used to precisely modify any location in the yeast genome (essential or non-essential) without the need for intermnediate strains carrying antibiotic or auxotrophic markers. We successfully demonstrated the protocol in our recent publication [Systematic Bacterilazation of Yeast Genes](https://elifesciences.org/articles/25093) by functionally replacing essential yeast genes with their bacterial or human orthologs. This protocol can be used to add N-terminal or C-terminal tags and introduce site-specific muations in yeast genes using appropriate repair templates (HDR-Homology Directed Repair) or simply just randomly mutating yeast genes (via NHEJ-Non-Homologous End Joining) without any repair template.
