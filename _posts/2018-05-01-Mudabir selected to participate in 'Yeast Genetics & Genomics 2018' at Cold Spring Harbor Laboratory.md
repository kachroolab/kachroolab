Many congratulations to [Mudabir Abdullah](http://twitter.com/@MMudabir) for his selection in a highly competitive and prestigious ['Yeast Genetics & Genomics 2018'](http://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=c-yeas&year=18) course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY, USA. He also received HHMI sponsored fellowship to cover partial cost of the course. We thank the organizers and the sponsors for this honor. While Mudabir is preparing hard on bench for this course, he is especially training for the famous ['Plate race'](http://meetings.cshl.edu/galleries/viewer.asp?directory=platerace17&offset=9) that has been a critical part of this course!!! We wish him well for both.
