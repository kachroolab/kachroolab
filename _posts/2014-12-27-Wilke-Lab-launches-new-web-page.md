Today, we're officially unveiling the new Wilke Lab web page at [wilkelab.org.](http://wilkelab.org) For the last couple of years, we had hosted our web page on the [openwetware](http://openwetware.org) wiki, at [wilke.openwetware.org.](http://wilke.openwetware.org) However, it was time to move on and develop a stand-alone page, and thus we have done so. The new page is hosted on [github,](http://github.com) and its source is freely available in a public [github repository.](http://github.com/wilkelab/wilkelab.github.io) Feel free to browse the code and look behind the scenes. The site is developed in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and makes extensive use of [Markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and of the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) templating language.
