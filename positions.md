**This research lab will start at the Concordia University, Montreal. on August 1st, 2017. Our group will use evolution and decades of work on model organisms as a guide for synthetic biology in simplified cells.**

The basic premise of our research is illustrated as follows:

The most deeply evolutionarily conserved human genes encode essential cellular machinery whose failures are linked to diverse diseases, such as cancer to cardiovascular disease. Recent systematic studies have discovered extensive genetic polymorphism in these genes yet studying how these variations contribute to cellular function and overall human health remains a challenge. Our group will focus on studying these conserved human genes along with many of their variants, by systematically “humanizing” yeast cells, replacing each of the essential yeast genes in turn by its human version. The resulting strains will serve as new physical reagents for studying the human genes in a simplified organismal context, opening up high-throughput assays of human gene function, analyzing the impact of human genetic variation on gene function. These humanized yeast will serve as test tubes for screening and repurposing of drugs and the rapid determination of mechanisms of drug resistance. Additionally, our research will illuminate fundamental principles of evolution, providing direct measurements of whether or not human and yeast genes have retained their ancestral functions over a billion years of evolutionary divergence.
